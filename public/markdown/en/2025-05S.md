As a member of the [**Swallow Project**](https://swallow-llm.github.io/index.ja.html), I have been involved in the development of the **Swallow LLM**, the construction of **evaluation infrastructure for large language models (LLMs)**, and the publication of evaluation results on the [**Swallow LLM Leaderboard**](https://swallow-llm.github.io/leaderboard/index-chat.ja.html).
