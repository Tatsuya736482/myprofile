I participated in the [AI Agent Hackathon with Google Cloud](https://zenn.dev/hackathons/2024-google-cloud-japan-ai-hackathon) and developed an application using Google Cloud Platform.

- **Frontend**: Flutter  
- **Backend**: Python  
- **Database**: Firebase

One of the core features I implemented was the removal of redundant content when saving multiple documents.  
This was achieved using **vector search** and **Gemini** to identify and filter out overlaps.

I also built a custom **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** pipeline, focusing on high performance, cost-efficiency, and scalability.

Details of the implementation are available here:
