During my study abroad at the University of California, Berkeley, I had the opportunity to listen to a researcher in natural language processing.  
It was then that I learned an eye-opening fact: **popular generative AIs like ChatGPT are essentially an extension of the neural networks I had already studied**.

Since then, I began self-studying natural language processing.  
Due to the lack of Japanese-language resources, I referred to Stanford University's [CS224N: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/) and taught myself the concepts.

I summarized what I learned in a multi-thousand-word article on *note*:
