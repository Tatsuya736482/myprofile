I participated in an 8-week summer session at the University of California, Berkeley, where I took the following computer science-related courses:

- [CS188 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/su24/) (GPA 4.0/4.0)  
- STAT155 Game Theory (GPA 3.7/4.0)

Since these were STEM courses, I was the only Japanese student in the class.  
However, I was able to make friends from diverse backgrounds, which greatly enriched my experience.  
Studying my major in English also boosted my confidence in my language skills.
