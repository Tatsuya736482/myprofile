I developed a web service that generates Apple Calendar events from the syllabus URL of Tokyo Science University.  
- **Frontend**: Gradio  
- **Backend**: Python  

The service scrapes the input URL and extracts essential information such as class times, locations, and course names to create calendar entries.
