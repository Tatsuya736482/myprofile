I redesigned the homepage for **Flap**, a student organization that offers study abroad consultations, using the following technologies:

- **Frontend**: Next.js  
- **Database**: Firebase  

The previous website used the free version of WordPress, which included intrusive ads and lacked a modern design, resulting in poor accessibility and user engagement.

Leveraging my experience, I rebuilt the site with a clean and accessible design and integrated **Google Analytics** for detailed traffic analysis.  
To improve cost efficiency, I implemented [**Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**](https://vercel.com/docs/incremental-static-regeneration), which allows the site to serve pre-rendered cached pagesâ€”minimizing Firebase read operations and optimizing performance.

Since this is a student-run website, I made sure the site would remain sustainable even after my departure.  
This included:
- Implementing a built-in content editor  
- Reducing operational costs to **Â¥0**
