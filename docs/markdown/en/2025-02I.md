I participated in a job-based long-term internship at **Sky Corporation**, where I was involved in system and tool development for internal DX (Digital Transformation).

- **Technologies used**:  
  - TypeScript  
  - Next.js  
  - ...and more

This internship offered hands-on experience in building real-world systems as part of a professional engineering team.
